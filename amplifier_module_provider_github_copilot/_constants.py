"""Constants for GitHub Copilot SDK provider.

This module defines constants used across the Copilot SDK provider implementation,
following the principle of single source of truth.

Timeout Philosophy:
- Unified 1-hour default for ALL models (both regular and thinking)
- Users with unlimited Copilot tokens shouldn't worry about premature timeouts
- Override via config if you need faster failure detection:
    {"timeout": 300, "thinking_timeout": 600}
- The SDK/model will reject quickly if parameters are invalid; we wait generously
  for valid requests that naturally take time (complex reasoning, long outputs)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MODEL ID NAMING CONVENTION (CRITICAL)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Copilot SDK uses PERIODS for version numbers, not dashes:
  - CORRECT: claude-opus-4.5, gpt-5.1
  - WRONG:   claude-opus-4-5, gpt-5-1

See `model_naming.py` for:
  - Full evidence-based documentation (from live SDK data)
  - Pattern parsing and validation utilities
  - is_thinking_model() for timeout selection

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  - Model ID format affects capability detection
  - Capability detection determines if model supports extended thinking
  - Extended thinking controls whether reasoning_effort is sent to API
  - API rejects reasoning_effort for non-thinking models → understanding format prevents errors

# Default configuration values
# Model IDs use PERIODS per Copilot SDK (not dashes like Anthropic API)
DEFAULT_MODEL = "claude-opus-4.5"
DEFAULT_DEBUG_TRUNCATE_LENGTH = 180

# Timeout configuration
# Unified 1-hour default for all models. Users with unlimited tokens shouldn't
# need to worry about premature timeouts. Override via config if needed:
#   {"timeout": 300, "thinking_timeout": 600}
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 3600.0  # 1 hour - generous default for all models
DEFAULT_THINKING_TIMEOUT = 3600.0  # 1 hour - same as regular (can differentiate later)

# Valid reasoning effort levels per Copilot SDK
VALID_REASONING_EFFORTS = frozenset({"low", "medium", "high", "xhigh"})

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# MODEL CACHE CONFIGURATION
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The model cache persists model metadata (context_window, max_output_tokens)
# to disk so that provider initialization can return accurate values without
# calling the SDK API every time.
#
# Cache is written by list_models() (called during `amplifier init`) and read
# during provider initialization (mount/constructor).
#
# Cross-platform: Uses pathlib.Path.home() which works on:
# - Linux: /home/<user>/.amplifier/cache/
# - WSL: /home/<user>/.amplifier/cache/
# - macOS: /Users/<user>/.amplifier/cache/
# - Windows: C:\Users\<user>\.amplifier\cache\

CACHE_FORMAT_VERSION = 1  # Increment on breaking schema changes
CACHE_FILE_NAME = "github-copilot-models.json"  # Provider-specific file
CACHE_STALE_DAYS = 30  # Log warning if cache older than this

# Maximum repaired tool IDs to track (LRU eviction)
MAX_REPAIRED_TOOL_IDS = 1000

# Buffer added to SDK-level timeout so our asyncio.timeout wins the race
# and provides consistent error handling. The SDK timeout acts as a fallback.
SDK_TIMEOUT_BUFFER_SECONDS = 5.0

# Client health check timeout (seconds).
# Used by ensure_client() to verify a cached client subprocess is still alive
# before returning it. Short timeout since ping should be near-instant for a
# healthy process. If this fails, the client is torn down and re-initialized.
# Evidence: TimeoutError in long-running sessions (~90min) where subprocess dies
# but _started flag remains True, causing all subsequent callers to get a dead client.
CLIENT_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT = 5.0

# Lock acquisition timeout for ensure_client() (seconds).
# Prevents callers from waiting indefinitely when another caller is stuck inside
# ensure_client() (e.g., blocked on a dead subprocess's start() call).
# Evidence: asyncio.Lock with no timeout caused sub-agent callers to queue forever
# behind a stuck initialization, producing 5516.9s elapsed times.
CLIENT_INIT_LOCK_TIMEOUT = 30.0

# Copilot SDK Built-in Tool Names
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The Copilot CLI binary registers its own built-in tools with each session.
# The CLI server runs its OWN internal agent loop — built-in tool calls are
# executed silently inside the CLI process and are INVISIBLE to the SDK caller.
# The SDK only sees the final response text after all built-in tool execution.
#
# This creates TWO distinct problems:
#
# 1. SHADOWING: If a user-defined tool has the same name as a built-in,
#    the built-in handler shadows it — the user handler is never called.
#
# 2. BYPASS: Even when names DON'T collide, the model may choose a built-in
#    tool (e.g., CLI's "edit") over the equivalent user tool (e.g.,
#    Amplifier's "write_file"), causing the CLI to execute internally and
#    bypass the orchestrator's tool execution pipeline entirely.
#
# Evidence (forensic analysis 2026-02-07):
#   - Session 497bbab7: Model used CLI's "edit" built-in to create a file
#     instead of Amplifier's "write_file" tool → tool_calls=0, output=2 tokens,
#     but file was created (CLI executed internally, invisible to provider)
#   - SHADOWING: grep, glob, web_fetch cause session hangs
#   - BYPASS: edit, view execute internally without triggering tool capture
#
# SOLUTION: When user tools are registered, ALL known built-in tools MUST be
# excluded to ensure the Amplifier orchestrator has complete control over tool execution.
#
# NOTE: This set should be updated if the CLI adds new built-in tools.
# Source: SDK e2e tests, agentic-workflow.json schema, SDK hook docs.

# Built-in → Amplifier Capability Mapping
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Maps each CLI built-in tool to Amplifier tool names whose capabilities
# overlap. A built-in is excluded if ANY of its mapped Amplifier tools
# are registered, preventing the model from choosing the built-in over
# the orchestrator-controlled version.
#
# IMPORTANT: Excluding ALL built-ins at once hangs the CLI (tested 2026-02-07,
# session 2a1fe04a). Only exclude built-ins that have a corresponding
# user-registered tool.
#
# Evidence:
#   - Session 497bbab7: "edit" not excluded → CLI bypassed orchestrator
#   - Session 2a1fe04a: ALL 13 excluded → CLI hangs indefinitely
#   - Working: Exclude only overlapping built-ins

# USER-FACING MESSAGE CONSTANTS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# These constants are used in error messages shown to users. They are defined
# here to ensure:
#   1. Single source of truth (no duplicated/inconsistent strings)

#
# TDD Gap Fixed: Prior to v1.0.2, error messages had hardcoded strings that
# were never validated against actual PyPI package names or CLI commands.
# See /memories/repo/tdd-gap-user-facing-strings.md for the full analysis.
