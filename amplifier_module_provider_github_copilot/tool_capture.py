# =============================================================================
# ARCHITECTURE NOTE: External Orchestration via Deny + Destroy
# =============================================================================
#
# CONTEXT:
# The Copilot SDK is designed for agentic workflows where the CLI server
# executes tools internally and returns final results. This provider has a
# different requirement: return tool calls to an external orchestrator
# (Amplifier) which handles execution, context management, and agent delegation.
#
# APPROACH:
# Force "capture-only" mode using the SDK's extensibility points:
#   1. Register tools with no-op handlers (LLM sees structured definitions)
#   2. Deny ALL execution via preToolUse hook (prevents CLI from running tools)
#   3. Capture tool_requests from ASSISTANT_MESSAGE streaming events
#   4. Destroy session after capture (prevents CLI retry with built-in tools)
#
# WHY SESSION DESTROY IS REQUIRED:
# Without immediate session destruction after tool capture, the CLI's internal
# agent loop retries with its built-in tools (e.g., 'edit' instead of our
# 'write_file'), bypassing the external orchestrator entirely. Empirically
# validated: session IDs 497bbab7, 2a1fe04a showed this bypass behavior.
#
# FRAGILITY NOTES:
# This pattern depends on SDK internal behavior that is not part of the
# public API contract:
#   - ASSISTANT_MESSAGE events fire before preToolUse hook
#   - preToolUse deny prevents handler invocation but allows event capture
#   - Session destroy reliably terminates the CLI's agent loop
# Changes to SDK event ordering or hook semantics could break this pattern.
#
# FUTURE SIMPLIFICATION:
# If the SDK adds an official "capture-only" or "external orchestration" mode
# that returns tool calls without attempting execution, this workaround can
# be replaced with that cleaner approach.
#

"""
Tool bridge for dumb-pipe pattern: Deny + Destroy.

This module bridges Amplifier's tool system with the Copilot SDK's
tool calling mechanism. It converts Amplifier ToolSpec objects to SDK
Tool objects and provides a preToolUse deny hook to prevent the CLI
from executing any tools internally.

Architecture (empirically validated via test_dumb_pipe_strategies.py):

1. Convert Amplifier ToolSpec → SDK Tool with no-op handler
2. Register preToolUse deny hook as safety belt
3. Register tools with SDK session → LLM sees structured definitions
4. Provider's event handler captures ASSISTANT_MESSAGE.tool_requests
5. Provider returns ToolCall objects to Amplifier's orchestrator
6. Session is destroyed by context manager (prevents CLI retry loop)

Why this works (Strategy 5: Deny + Destroy):
- Event capture from ASSISTANT_MESSAGE provides structured tool data
  (name, tool_call_id, arguments) BEFORE the CLI attempts execution
- preToolUse deny prevents handler execution during the gap between
  event capture and session destroy
- Session destroy prevents the CLI from retrying with built-in tools
  (empirically: without destroy, CLI falls back to built-in 'create')

What this replaces:
- Previous capture-and-abort pattern used handler blocking + abort()
- That was vulnerable to CLI bypass (built-in tools ran internally)
- The deny + destroy pattern eliminates both bypass and race conditions
