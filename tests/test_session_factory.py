"""
Tests for deny hook (in sdk_adapter/client.py).

Contract: contracts/deny-destroy.md

Acceptance Criteria:
- Deny hook is created with correct response
- Deny hook returns denial for all tool calls
- DENY_ALL constant has required keys

Note: create_ephemeral_session() and destroy_session() removed in Change 3.
Session lifecycle now handled by CopilotClientWrapper.session() context manager.
