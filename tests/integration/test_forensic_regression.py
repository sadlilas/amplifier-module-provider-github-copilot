"""
Forensic Regression Test: Reproduces the 305-Turn SDK Loop Incident.

This test module validates that the SDK Driver architecture ACTUALLY FIXES
the bug discovered during forensic analysis of session a1a0af17:

    ORIGINAL BUG (Feb 7, 2026):
    - Prompt: "Use the bug-hunter agent to check if there are any obvious
      issues in the models.py file."
    - Result: 305 SDK turns, 607 accumulated tool calls, 303 bug-hunter
      agents spawned, 20-minute hang
    - Root cause: No first-turn capture, no session abort, no circuit breaker

    EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (after SDK Driver fix):
    - Same prompt triggers tool calls (delegate + report_intent)
    - SDK Driver captures first turn only
    - Session is aborted immediately after capture
    - ≤3 turns (not 305)
    - ≤10 tool calls (not 607)
    - Completes in <60 seconds (not 20 minutes)

Tests are skipped by default. Run with:
    RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1 python -m pytest tests/integration/test_forensic_regression.py -v -s

Prerequisites:
    - Copilot CLI installed and in PATH
    - Valid GitHub Copilot authentication
    - Network access

Architecture:
    - SDK Driver with first-turn capture and session abort
    - Circuit breaker prevents runaway tool call loops
